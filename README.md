## Packaging
### Arch Linux
- [xdm-hack](https://github.com/aakashhemadri/xdm-hack/blob/master/Makefile) - An XDM theme primarily for arch linux.
## Languages
### c
- [yaruu](https://github.com/aakashhemadri/yaruu/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) - yet another rsync wrapper.
- [sniffy](https://github.com/aakashhemadri/sniffy/blob/master/Makefile) - dead before it even started.
### cpp
- [img-blur](https://github.com/aakashhemadri/img-blur/blob/develop/cpp/Makefile) - A simple image blur utility
- [text-editor](https://github.com/aakashhemadri/text-editor/blob/master/Makefile) - A POSIX editor.
- [gdb](https://github.com/aakashhemadri/pragma/blob/master/lectures/2019/10/04/gdb/Makefile) - simple makefile for compiling cpp with gdb.
### lex
- [yacp](https://github.com/aakashhemadri/yacp/blob/master/Makefile) - yet another config parse, written in lex.
## Complexity
Complexity is relative, I'll leave it at that
### Basic
Usually single file, basic options.
### Moderate
Usually multi file, multi options, external deps, possibly packaging.
### Complex
Usually multi file, multi options, external deps, packaging, multi-target.
## Repository
Makefiles listed repository wise.
